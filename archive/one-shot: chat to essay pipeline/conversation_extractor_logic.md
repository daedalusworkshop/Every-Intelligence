```

## Main Extractor Class Logic

### Initialization
```
WHEN ConversationExtractor is created:
  SET UP empty extractor ready to process conversations
  NO special configuration needed
```

### Public Interface Methods

#### Extract From File Method
```
WHEN extract_from_file is called WITH file_path:
  
  STEP 1: Determine file format
    CREATE path_object FROM file_path
    EXAMINE file_extension
    
    IF extension is ".html":
      REASON: This is likely a ChatGPT export or saved webpage
      ACTION: CALL _extract_from_html_file WITH file_path
    
    ELSE IF extension is ".json":
      REASON: This is likely a Claude export or structured conversation data
      ACTION: CALL _extract_from_json_file WITH file_path
    
    ELSE IF extension is ".txt":
      REASON: This is likely a plain text conversation
      ACTION: CALL _extract_from_text_file WITH file_path
    
    ELSE:
      REASON: We don't know how to handle this file type
      ACTION: RAISE error "Unsupported file format: {extension}"
  
  RETURN: ConversationContext object with extracted intelligence
```

#### Extract From Text Method
```
WHEN extract_from_text is called WITH conversation_text:
  
  REASON: User has provided raw conversation text directly
  ACTION: CALL _extract_from_raw_text WITH conversation_text
  RETURN: ConversationContext object with extracted intelligence
```

## HTML Processing Logic

### HTML File Processing
```
WHEN _extract_from_html_file is called WITH file_path:
  
  STEP 1: Read the file
    OPEN file_path FOR reading WITH utf-8 encoding
    READ entire_content INTO memory
  
  STEP 2: Try to extract structured conversation data
    CALL _extract_conversation_from_html WITH entire_content
    STORE result AS conversation_data
  
  STEP 3: Process based on what we found
    IF conversation_data exists:
      REASON: We found structured conversation data in the HTML
      ACTION: CALL _analyze_conversation_structure WITH conversation_data
    
    ELSE:
      REASON: No structured data found, fall back to visible text extraction
      ACTION: 
        PARSE entire_content WITH BeautifulSoup html_parser
        EXTRACT visible_text FROM parsed_html
        CALL _extract_from_raw_text WITH visible_text
  
  RETURN: ConversationContext object
```

### HTML Conversation Data Extraction
```
WHEN _extract_conversation_from_html is called WITH html_content:
  
  STEP 1: Look for specific known patterns first
    REASON: ChatGPT exports often have specific message patterns we can identify
    
    SEARCH FOR pattern: "Every has thought.*?" in html_content
    ALLOW pattern to span multiple lines
    
    IF pattern found:
      EXTRACT user_message FROM matched_text
      
      CLEAN user_message:
        REPLACE "\\n" WITH actual_newlines
        REPLACE '\\"' WITH actual_quotes  
        REPLACE "\\\\" WITH single_backslashes
      
      SEARCH FOR ai_response_patterns:
        TRY pattern: "Let.*?s Stress-Test the Core Idea.*?"
        TRY pattern: "Problem to Beat.*?"
        TRY pattern: "Interaction Model Variants.*?"
      
      FOR EACH ai_response_pattern:
        IF pattern found in html_content:
          EXTRACT ai_response FROM matched_text
          CLEAN ai_response (same cleaning as user_message)
          BREAK out of loop
      
      RETURN structured_conversation_data:
        user_messages: [cleaned_user_message]
        ai_responses: [cleaned_ai_response] IF ai_response exists ELSE []
        conversation_type: "chatgpt_shared"
  
  STEP 2: Look for embedded JSON data patterns
    REASON: Many web apps embed conversation data as JSON in script tags
    
    TRY conversation_patterns:
      - '"messages":\s*\[(.*?)\]'
      - '"conversation":\s*{(.*?)}'  
      - 'window\.__INITIAL_STATE__\s*=\s*({.*?});'
      - 'window\.__reactRouterContext\s*=\s*({.*?});'
    
    FOR EACH pattern:
      SEARCH FOR pattern in html_content
      ALLOW pattern to span multiple lines
      
      IF pattern found:
        TRY:
          EXTRACT json_string FROM matched_text
          CLEAN json_string:
            REMOVE "window.__VARIABLE_NAME__ = " prefixes
            REMOVE trailing semicolons
          
          PARSE json_string AS json_data
          RETURN json_data
        
        CATCH any_parsing_errors:
          CONTINUE to next pattern
  
  STEP 3: No structured data found
    RETURN null
```

## Text Processing Logic

### Raw Text Extraction
```
WHEN _extract_from_raw_text is called WITH text:
  
  STEP 1: Separate user and AI messages
    CALL _split_conversation_text WITH text
    RECEIVE user_messages AND ai_responses
  
  STEP 2: Extract intelligence from the conversation
    CALL _analyze_conversation_content WITH user_messages, ai_responses, text
    RECEIVE conversation_context
  
  RETURN conversation_context
```

### Conversation Text Splitting
```
WHEN _split_conversation_text is called WITH text:
  
  STEP 1: Clean up the text
    DECODE html_entities (like &amp; becomes &)
    REPLACE "\\n" WITH actual_newlines
    REPLACE '\\"' WITH actual_quotes
  
  STEP 2: Initialize storage
    CREATE empty user_messages list
    CREATE empty ai_responses list
  
  STEP 3: Try common conversation patterns
    DEFINE conversation_patterns:
      Pattern Set 1:
        user_pattern: "User:(.*?)(?=Assistant:|AI:|ChatGPT:|$)"
        ai_pattern: "(?:Assistant:|AI:|ChatGPT:)(.*?)(?=User:|$)"
      
      Pattern Set 2:
        user_pattern: "Human:(.*?)(?=AI:|Assistant:|$)"
        ai_pattern: "(?:AI:|Assistant:)(.*?)(?=Human:|$)"
      
      Pattern Set 3:
        user_pattern: "You:(.*?)(?=ChatGPT:|Claude:|$)"
        ai_pattern: "(?:ChatGPT:|Claude:)(.*?)(?=You:|$)"
    
    FOR EACH pattern_set:
      SEARCH FOR user_pattern in text (case_insensitive, multiline)
      SEARCH FOR ai_pattern in text (case_insensitive, multiline)
      
      IF either pattern found matches:
        EXTRACT all user_matches
        EXTRACT all ai_matches
        CLEAN each match (remove extra whitespace)
        ADD matches to respective lists
        BREAK out of pattern loop
  
  STEP 4: Fallback if no patterns matched
    IF no user_messages AND no ai_responses:
      REASON: Standard patterns didn't work, try to infer structure
      CALL _infer_conversation_structure WITH text
      RECEIVE user_messages, ai_responses
  
  RETURN user_messages, ai_responses
```

      IF count > 0:
        STORE count AS domain_scores[domain]
  
  STEP 3: Determine best match

        EXTRACT matched_text
        REMOVE extra whitespace
        RETURN cleaned_matched_text
  
  STEP 2: Fallback approach

    SPLIT text INTO sentences (by periods)
    EXAMINE first_3_sentences only
    
    FOR EACH sentence:
      IF sentence contains any of [problem, challenge, issue, trying, want, need]:

  STEP 1: Create extractor instance
    CREATE new ConversationExtractor
  
  STEP 2: Test with known file
    TRY:
      CALL extract_from_file WITH 'chatgpt extraction/chatgpt_response.html'
      STORE result AS context
      
      PRINT "=== EXTRACTED CONVERSATION INTELLIGENCE ==="

      RETURN context
    
    CATCH any_error:

```

## Main Execution Logic
```
WHEN this file is run directly:
  CALL test_extractor()
```

## Overall Processing Pipeline
```
CONVERSATION_INTELLIGENCE_EXTRACTION_PIPELINE:

  INPUT_STAGE:
    RECEIVE: conversation_file OR raw_conversation_text
  
  FORMAT_DETECTION_STAGE:
    ANALYZE file_extension OR content_structure
    ROUTE TO: html_processor OR json_processor OR text_processor
  
  CONTENT_EXTRACTION_STAGE:
    IF html_format:
      TRY extract_structured_data FROM embedded_json
      FALLBACK TO visible_text_extraction
    
    IF json_format:
      PARSE structured_message_data
      FALLBACK TO raw_text_processing
    
    IF text_format:
      PROCESS as_raw_conversation_text
  
  MESSAGE_SEPARATION_STAGE:
    IDENTIFY user_messages AND ai_responses
    USE pattern_matching OR structure_inference
    CLEAN escaped_characters AND formatting
  
  INTELLIGENCE_ANALYSIS_STAGE:
    EXTRACT problem_analysis (domain, statement, complexity)
    ANALYZE thinking_process (patterns, frameworks, decisions)
    IDENTIFY context_clues (topics, style, focus)
    DETERMINE conversation_flow
  
  OUTPUT_STAGE:
    PACKAGE all_extracted_intelligence INTO ConversationContext
    RETURN structured_intelligence_object

  ERROR_HANDLING:
    AT_EACH_STAGE: provide_fallback_methods
    LOG errors_with_full_context
    NEVER fail_completely (always_return_something_useful)
```

This English logic format makes every aspect of the conversation extractor transparent and intuitive to follow, while preserving all the functionality and decision-making logic of the original Python code.
